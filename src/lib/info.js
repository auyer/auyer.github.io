I'm Rafael, a software engineer based in Brazil. I began my career as a 
researcher, but migrated to the tech industry in 2019.
I'm a curious individual. 
I started with (web) software development in Golang. Due to company needs and my interests, I specialized in Data Engineering and even led a squad. 
Besides all that, I worked with a fair share of Cloud Infrastructure and Kubernetes, developed in Python and Rust, and other things.
