      <description>Hi There ! Thank you for visiting my page. About me ? Hmm let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m curious. Very curious. This curiosity drove me towards science.
My main research topic is Machine-Learning. Once I started looking into it, I had no choice but to go deeper. There are so many possibilities and so many areas that could benefit from this knowledge !
I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a fair bit of Micro-Services research with the Latitude UnB research group!</description>
