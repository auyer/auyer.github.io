I began my career as a researcher but migrated to the tech industry in 2019.
I'm a curious individual. 
I started with (web) software development in Golang.
After that, I specialized in Data Engineering and created a data-focused squad. 
Besides all this, I worked with a fair share of Cloud Infrastructure and Kubernetes, doing development in Golang, Python, and Rust.
