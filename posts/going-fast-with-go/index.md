title: Going Fast With Go - an introduction to Golang (slides)
date: 2019-08-01
---

This is a (small) presentation I gave to my coworkers at CEPESC. At the time, most of the software there was written in Java, and our team (researchers from the Federal University of Brasilia) was developing in Python. I was advocating using Golang in some performance-critical areas of our system.
